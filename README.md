# City Route [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) App

A simple app that determines if two cities are connected.
Two cities are considered connected if thereâ€™s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another.

This app is written in programmin language java, and also use [Swagger Api](www,swagger.io)

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) or above

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.takehomechallenge` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
* **URL**

  /connected?origin=city1&destination=city2

* **Method:**

  `GET`
  
*  **URL Params**

   **Required:**

* **Data Params**
    
    source=[string]`
    
    destination=[string]

* **Success Response:**

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
    **Content:** `{ string : yes|no : "yes"  or "no}`
 
* **Error Response:**

    * **NONE**
 

######This app exposes  *one* **endpoint** while running on localost and on default port:
```shell
http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=city1&destination=city2
```
######To access Swagger UI use the following link when your app is running on localhost on default 
port: 8080, otherwise change your hostname and port number accordingly:
```aidl
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

```

###Usage

    - See *application.properties* for configuration
    
    - Populate data.txt file as necessary

```aidl
    ### Run the app
    $ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```


###Client Sample:

```aidl
   Input data file city.txt content is:

     Boston, New York

     Philadelphia, Newark

     Newark, Boston

     Trenton, Albany
```

```aidl

    #invoke rest api end point:
    - Curl: 
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Newark&origin=Boston" -H "accept: */*"
    Request URL:
    http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Newark&origin=Boston
    Server Response: yes
    Code:200


    - Curl: 
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Philadelphia&origin=Boston" -H "accept: */*"
    Request URL:
    http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Philadelphia&origin=Boston
    Server Response: yes
    Code:200

    - Curl: 
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Albany&origin=Philadelphia" -H "accept: */*"
    Request URL:
    http://localhost:8080/connected?destination=Albany&origin=Philadelphia
    Server Response: no
    Code:200

```

## Roadmap
Varous endpoints that would be invoked using methods such as **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE** will the added. Also Spring Security will be in place
to secure various endpoints that would allow to *add new route, *update* an existin route or *delete* existing one. **Input data** file would be accessed from *Sprin Boot 
Config Server* that would use *Github* as *backend*.
