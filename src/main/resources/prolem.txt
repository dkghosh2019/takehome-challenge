CODE CHALLENGE



You’re asked to write a program in Java which determines if two cities are connected.

Two cities are considered connected if there’s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another.



List of roads is available in a file.

File contains a list of city pairs (one pair per line, comma separated), which indicates that there’s a road between those cities.



It will be deployed as a spring-boot app and expose one endpoint:

http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=city1&destination=city2



Your program should respond with ‘yes’ if city1 is connected to city2, ’no’ if city1 is not connected to city2.

Any unexpected input should result in a ’no’ response.



Example:

city.txt content is:

Boston, New York

Philadelphia, Newark

Newark, Boston

Trenton, Albany



http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Newark

Should return yes

http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Boston&destination=Philadelphia

Should return yes

http://localhost:8080/connected?origin=Philadelphia&destination=Albany

Should return no
